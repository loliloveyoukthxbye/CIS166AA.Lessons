    <p>The modules I reviewed in this week's lesson was a fantastic refresher of 
        what I learned about JavaScript in my first web development course (CIS133DA).
        We reviewed the basic components of JavaScript which included defining 
        variables, events and objects. We covered how to comment when building out
        our JavaScript code and how to open the console in the web browser to run JavaScript
        code and see the results in the browser right away. The most important lesson
        I've learned this week was JavaScript coding standards which I am still working
        to commit to memory.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is an extremely useful tool to use in web development because
        it can be used to add interactive features to the webpage. We can use functions, for example, to add features like pop-up form validations or updates
        like <i>"last updated"</i> with a timestamp at the bottom of a webpage. We can use loops
        to tell the program to repeat instructions, for example, we can create an
        interactive feature like an animation with a loop. </p>

1. Why are you taking this class? What do you hope to learn?
I'm taking this class because I must learn at least three programming languages to satisfy my degree requirement. 
I am pursuing an Associates degree in Applied Science, Information Technology and plan to apply for graduation after completing my courses in Spring 2025.
I hope to learn how to code JavaScript proficiently enough to leverage my knowledge to get an entry-level developer job.

2. What challenges did you encounter in completing this project, and how did you overcome them?
I am still learning to master the relationship between GitHub and VS code, I had a little trouble getting my newly established .js, .css and .html pages
to save into a repo in GitHub. Through trial and error, I eventually figured it out but I am still learning how to use GitHub tools to the best of my ability.
